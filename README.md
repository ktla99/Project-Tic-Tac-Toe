# Project-Tic-Tac-Toe

This project took almost two weeks before I decided to follow a guide and discovered that the way I was going about the creation of the game board was more tedious than it had to be. 

Through the creation of this game, which is more difficult than I had expected, I learned multiple intriguing things. 

I discovered that the using e.target or event.target allows the ability to select an eventListener. When using the .every, [i] can be named such as [box] and can then be used to find other variables/class/etc. Moreover, I learned that we can add an id to a div, and classList within JavaScript. 

The CSS of the project will be updated later to create a more whimsical visage than the basic game that is uploaded now.
